Act as a "literary magnifier." I want you to take the following target text (or the most recent scene if no text is specified) and rewrite it to be significantly longer.

**Target to Expand:** $ARGUMENTS

**Directives:**
1.  **Sensory Explosion:** Do not just describe visuals. You must include details regarding **Smell**, **Sound**, **Texture**, or **Temperature**.
2.  **Deep POV:** Dive into the character's internal monologue and visceral physical reactions (heart rate, adrenaline, muscle tension).
3.  **Micro-Actions:** Break summary actions into specific beats. (e.g., Change "He loaded the gun" to a detailed description of sliding the magazine in and checking the chamber).
4.  **Show, Don't Tell:** Replace abstract adjectives (nervous, scary) with physical descriptions.

**Constraint:** The rewritten version must be **50% longer** than the original.
